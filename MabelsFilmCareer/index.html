  <section>
<p>In the past few decades several scholars have developed important revaluations of early film production in the United States, with a particular focus on highlighting the achievements and contributions of women who wrote, directed, and produced these early films. A leading example of this movement is the <a href="https://wfpp.columbia.edu">Women Film Pioneers Project</a>.</p>

<p>
  One figure of unique standing in early cinema is comedienne, actor, director, and producer Mabel Normand. After a rapid rise to prominence in silent comedies in the mid 1910, health issues and involvement with several high profile scandals at the peak of her career limited her opportunities for further work. Several film scholars and historians lament that her accomplishments are not better known and recognized more widely, which may be attributable to accounts from her better known creative partners and collaborators (namely Mack Sennett and Charlie Chaplin) that diminish her contributions and influence for the sake of emphasizing their own. Placing her career in comparison to theirs would not be productive, so instead this project simply aims to examine the distinctiveness and notable qualities of Normand’s work.
<br></br>
While there has been invaluable work done to assess the extent to which her achievements and contributions to silent comedy, much of her history and legacy remain grounded in speculation. This is in part due to a combination of the reasons mentioned above, but also due to widespread infatuation with Normand’s that extends into scholarship about her work. As Simon Joyce and Jennifer Putzi in explain their Women Film Pioneers <a href="https://wfpp.columbia.edu/pioneer/ccp-mabel-normand/">entry</a> on Normand:</p>
<br></br>
<blockquote>
“Even after her death, scholars have been more interested in the gossip surrounding Normand’s life and romances (including an announced marriage to Sennett in 1915 that never materialized) than her work...Scholars would do well to refocus attention on Normand’s distinctive contribution to early cinema and slapstick comedy, as well as the nature of her directorial work for Keystone.”
If scholarship thus far has indulged too much in speculation and scandal, then grounding the story of Normand’s career in filmography data alone might offer an instructive realignment.

  If scholarship thus far has indulged too much in speculation and scandal, then grounding the story of Normand’s career in filmography data alone might offer an instructive realignment.
<br></br>
This project site employs a combination of visual storytelling tools, data visualization tools, and film clips to display a few dimensions on which we can assess the degree to which Mabel Normand’s career was emblematic or exceptional relative to early motion picture production trends and conventions.
<br></br>
These observations and the data visualization that enable them are by no means meant to be taken as conclusive but instead should be viewed as pointers towards several avenues for further scholarship and inquiry into Normand’s career and her place within the history of silent comedies.
</p>

  <p>
  While these pages have been sorted into a “seven act” format, users should not feel obligated to navigate them in order.There is no larger organizing principle beyond these two diverging questions:
  </p>
  <ol>
<li>
<p>1)How was Normand’s career emblematic of trends in silent comedy production?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2) How was Normand’s career exceptional relative to major trends in silent comedy production?</p>
</li>
</ol>

  <p>
  In developing some analysis grounded in this data, a third, reflexive, question organizing the narrative of this project emerges:
  </p>
  <ol>
      <li><p>3)What can be gained and what is lost (or must be compensated for) when using filmography data alone to account for the importance, distinctive qualities, meaning, and influence of a single person’s work?
      </p></li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    It might come as no surprise that quantitative visualizations alone cannot adequately account for what makes Normand and her work significant. To this point, I have included some historical context where possible, some brief commentary, and a curated selection of distinctive performances.
    <br></br>
    In short, this project juggles three guiding questions, how was Mabel Normand and her career <em> emblematic, exceptional,</em> or <em>beyond our methods</em>.
