  <section>
<p>In the past few decades several scholars have developed important revaluations of early film production in the United States, with a particular focus on highlighting the achievements and contributions of women who wrote, directed, and produced these early films. The most notable of these efforts include the <a href="https://wfpp.columbia.edu">Women Film Pioneers Project</a>.</p>

<p>One figure of unique standing in early cinema is comedienne, actress, director, and producer Mabel Normand. Her involvement with several high profile scandals at the peak of her career undercut the commercial success of her films, and her legacy was hampered by the self-aggrandizing accounts from her better known creative partners and collaborators (namely Mack Sennett and Charlie Chaplin). While there has been invaluable work done to reassess her achievements and contributions to silent comedy, much of her history and legacy remains grounded in speculation. This is in part due to a combination of the reasons mentioned above, but also due to a widespread infatuation with Normand’s that extends into scholarship about her work. As Simon Joyce and Jennifer Putzi in explain their Women Film Pioneers <a href="https://wfpp.columbia.edu/pioneer/ccp-mabel-normand/">entry</a> on Normand:</p>
<br></br>
<blockquote>
“Even after her death, scholars have been more interested in the gossip surrounding Normand’s life and romances (including an announced marriage to Sennett in 1915 that never materialized) than her work...Scholars would do well to refocus attention on Normand’s distinctive contribution to early cinema and slapstick comedy, as well as the nature of her directorial work for Keystone.”
If scholarship thus far has indulged too much in speculation and scandal, then grounding the story of Normand’s career in filmography data alone might offer an instructive realignment.
</blockquote>
<br></br>
<p>This project site employs a combination of visual storytelling tools, data visualization tools, and film clips to display a few dimensions on which we can assess the degree to which Mabel Normand’s career was emblematic or exceptional relative to early motion picture production trends and conventions.</p>

<p>These observations and the data visualization that enable them are by no means meant to be taken as conclusive but instead should be viewed as pointers towards several avenues for further scholarship and inquiry into Normand’s career and her place within the history of comedy in the United States. Navigating through this project site, users can explore visualizations and analysis of the studios, directors, titles, roles, and performances that shaped Normand’s career. While these pages have been sorted into a “seven act” format, users should not feel obligated to navigate them in order. There is no larger organizing principle beyond these two diverging questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>1) How was Normand’s career emblematic of major trends in United States Silent Comedy production?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2) How was Normand’s career exceptional relative to major trends in United States Silent Comedy production?</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The most obvious hurdle to using filmography data alone, is that roughly half of Normand’s films survive. Further, some records of Normand’s filmography--much like accounts of her life--display contradictory information. These missing and conflicting records make conclusive evaluations of Normand’s achievements and contributions difficult to point out. However I contend that because there is little else to go on, the information that does remain is still worth using to give a sense of the ways in which Normand was a key figure in the history of film comedy.</P>
